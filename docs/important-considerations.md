> [!NOTE]
>  Not all central ATC checks can be run against all releases in your system landscape. As an example, ATC checks for ABAP CDS donâ€™t make sense on older releases. You have to check carefully whether the checks used will work against the release.

- If you intend to run ATC for the objects in your own custom namespaces (other as Z* or Y* namespaces), you will need to register custom namespaces of the checked systems at the central ATC system.
